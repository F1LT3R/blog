This guide walks you though creating a Cordova app for Push Notifications on iOS and Android. We will use the Apache Cordova platform and the Amazon SNS service to build and test our Push Notifications.

The guide is split into three parts:

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Base Steps](#base-steps)
3. [iOS APNS Guide](#ios-apns-guide)
4. [Android GCM or FCM Guide](#android-gcm-or-fcm-guide)

## Overview

There is a lot to learn about Push Notifications, but the intention here is to get you up and running with a proof of concept.

In this guide you will learn how to:

- Create a sample Cordova app with the phonegap-push-plugin
- Obtain a device registrationId (also known as a Device Token) from the Sample App that can used to send you Push Notifications across the network.
- Create APNS and GCM certificates for your app
- Push APNS and GCM notifications to your app via the Amazon SNS console.

You will need:

- MacOS High Sierra ‚Äî ^10.13.1
- Homebrew ‚Äî 1.4.0
- Node.js ‚Äî v9.2.1
- NPM ‚Äî 5.5.1
- Xcode ‚Äî 9.2 (9C40b)
- Git ‚Äî 2.13.1
- Cordova ‚Äî 7.0.1
- Gradle ‚Äî 4.4

### Useful Terminology

- APNS ‚Äî Apple Push Notification Service
- GCM ‚Äî Google Cloud Messaging
- FCM ‚Äî Firebase Cloud Messaging (GCM is now replaced/included in FCM)
- SNS ‚Äî Amazon Simple Notification Service (Not to be confused with SMS)

### Amazon Guides

Amazon provides the following guides setup guides for APNS and GCM. I found some of the information in these to be out of date, or too hairy for a JavaScript developer who can not bring himself to install Eclipse.

- [APNS (iOS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-apns.html)
- [GCM (Android)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-gcm.html)

The steps you are about to read, are split into three sections:

## Base Steps

Create your app with the Cordova CLI tool.

```cli-wrap
cordova create cordova-remote-push-notifications org.apache.cordova.RemotePushNotificationsApp RemotePushNotificationsApp
```

Change to the directory that was created by the Cordova CLI tool.

```cli
cd cordova-remote-push-notifications
```

Install android Android and iOS platforms.

> **Note:** `android@latest` is not currently compatible with `code-push@latest` (2017‚Äì12‚Äì12), so we will need to set the android platform version to `6.3.0`.

```cli
cordova platform add android@6.3.0
cordova platform add ios@latest
```

Install CocoaPods Xcode Package Manager if you do not already have this installed.

```cli
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Setup the Cocoapod `master` repo.

```cli
pod setup
```

Install the Cocoapod depencies in the iOS platform directory.

```cli
cd platforms/ios/
pod install
```

Install `Phonegap-Plugin-Push`.

```cli
cordova plugin add phonegap-plugin-push
```

Add the following code to `www/js/index.js` the `onDeviceReady()` callback:

```js
onDeviceReady: function() {
    this.receivedEvent('deviceready');

    var push = PushNotification.init({
        android: {},
        browser: {
            pushServiceURL: 'http://push.api.phonegap.com/v1/push'
        },
        ios: {
            alert: "true",
            badge: "true",
            sound: "true"
        },
        windows: {}
    });

    push.on('registration', function (data) {
        console.dir(data)
        alert('Event=registration, registrationId=' + data.registrationId)
    });

    push.on('notification', function (data) {
        console.log(data)
        alert('Event=notification, message=' + data.message)
    });

    push.on('error', function (err) {
        console.log(err)
        alert('Event=error, message=' + err.message)
    });
},
```

## iOS APNS Guide

Use the terminal to open the workspace in Xcode.

```cli-wrap
open -a Xcode platforms/ios/RemotePushNotificationsApp.xcworkspace
```

> ### ü§î Choice
>  
> You will be prompted to select:  
>  
> 1. The correct certificate.
> 2. The device you want to push the build to.

While you are in Xcode, Toggle on "Push Notifications".

[![While you are in Xcode, Toggle on "Push Notifications".](/img/posts/1_1n_DM_lvZx4bft4yHfOYpw.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_1n_DM_lvZx4bft4yHfOYpw.jpeg "While you are in Xcode, Toggle on "Push Notifications".")

Build and run your App.

```cli
cordova build ios
cordova run ios
```

> While the app is running on your iOS device, get the `registrationId` logged in the Safari Developer Console. Save this `registrationId` somewhere, you will need to send messages to the device via the Amazon SNS console.

[![Screenshot of Safari developer console with the Registration Id](/img/posts/1_J295qcQd2B_Pd3G5CVTEtA.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_J295qcQd2B_Pd3G5CVTEtA.jpeg "Screenshot of Safari developer console with the Registration Id")

If you click the Done button you will see that your Push cert is now listed.

[![If you click the Done button you will see that your Push cert is now listed.](/img/posts/1_Rpk1w1FCdWVBf1IoL0D5Dg.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_Rpk1w1FCdWVBf1IoL0D5Dg.jpeg "If you click the Done button you will see that your Push cert is now listed.")

Click the Download button to save your push certificate to the Desktop. It should download a file with a `.cer` extension

In your terminal, convert the `.cer` file to a `.pem.`. The Amazon SNS service uses the `.pem` file format.

```cli-wrap
openssl x509 -in ~/Desktop/aps_development.cer -inform DER -out ~/Desktop/PushCert.pem
```

### Obtain the App Private Key

Import the Apple Push Notifications certificate (aps_development.cer) that your downloaded from the Apple Developer Portal earlier, into the Keychain Access app.

[![Import the Apple Push Notifications certificate aps_development.cer that your downloaded from the Apple Developer Portal earlier, into the Keychain Access app.](/img/posts/1__4CBwDrRXB8rHiH2V3ff_Q.jpeg)](/img/posts/1__4CBwDrRXB8rHiH2V3ff_Q.jpeg "Import the Apple Push Notifications certificate aps_development.cer that your downloaded from the Apple Developer Portal earlier, into the Keychain Access app.")

You should see the certificate listed with the name of your app.

[![You should see the certificate listed with the name of your app.](/img/posts/1_NbxsR-xkHP370aQ_P1uMlg.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_NbxsR-xkHP370aQ_P1uMlg.jpeg "You should see the certificate listed with the name of your app.")

Expand your certificate and select the private key. Right click and export your Private Push Key to a `.p12` file.

[![Expand your certificate and select the private key. Right click and export your Private Push Key to a .p12 file.](/img/posts/1_bKqKUAK9JrQYT3oSXQVKBQ.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_bKqKUAK9JrQYT3oSXQVKBQ.jpeg "Expand your certificate and select the private key. Right click and export your Private Push Key to a .p12 file.")

Save the key file to the Desktop, naming it "PushKey".

[![Save the key file to the Desktop, naming it "PushKey".](/img/posts/1_nFVQvXYhfsWco1MrrMovmA.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_nFVQvXYhfsWco1MrrMovmA.jpeg "Save the key file to the Desktop, naming it "PushKey".")

You sill be asked to provide an encryption password for your private key file.

[![You sill be asked to provide an encryption password for your private key file.](/img/posts/1_sSoQ8id0qfaPYS38FWBw8w.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_sSoQ8id0qfaPYS38FWBw8w.jpeg "You sill be asked to provide an encryption password for your private key file.")

You will likely be asked to enter your system or login password in order to export your private key from the Keychain Access app to the file-system.

[![You will likely be asked to enter your system or login password in order to export your private key from the Keychain Access app to the file-system.](/img/posts/1_IGVzq_EMJophqgqWzm1A8A.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_IGVzq_EMJophqgqWzm1A8A.jpeg "You will likely be asked to enter your system or login password in order to export your private key from the Keychain Access app to the file-system.")

Convert the `PushKey.p12` file to a `PushKey.pem` file using `openssl` in your terninal.

```cli-wrap
openssl pkcs12 -in ~/Desktop/PushKey.p12 -out ~/Desktop/PushKey.pem -nodes -clcerts

# Enter Import Password: ************
# MAC verified OK
```

### Verify the Certificate and App Private Key

```cli-wrap
openssl s_client -connect gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195 -cert ~/Desktop/PushCert.pem -key ~/Desktop/PushKey.pem
```

If you see something like the following block in your terminal, then everything is working as expected.

```bash
