This guide walks you though creating a [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) app for Push Notifications on iOS and Android. We will use the Apache Cordova platform and the [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) service to build and test our Push Notifications.

The guide is split into four main sections:

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Base Steps](#base-steps)
3. [iOS APNS Guide](#ios-apns-guide)
4. [Android GCM or FCM Guide](#android-gcm-or-fcm-guide)

## Overview

There is a lot to learn about Push Notifications, but the intention here is to get you up and running with a proof of concept.

In this guide you will learn how to:

- Create a sample Cordova app with the phonegap-push-plugin
- Obtain a device registrationId (also known as a Device Token) from the Sample App that can used to send you Push Notifications across the network.
- Create APNS and GCM certificates for your app
- Push APNS and GCM notifications to your app via the Amazon SNS console.

You will need:

- MacOS High Sierra ‚Äî ^10.13.1
- Homebrew ‚Äî 1.4.0
- Node.js ‚Äî v9.2.1
- NPM ‚Äî 5.5.1
- Xcode ‚Äî 9.2 (9C40b)
- Git ‚Äî 2.13.1
- Cordova ‚Äî 7.0.1
- Gradle ‚Äî 4.4

### Useful Terminology

- APNS ‚Äî Apple Push Notification Service
- GCM ‚Äî Google Cloud Messaging
- FCM ‚Äî Firebase Cloud Messaging (GCM is now replaced/included in FCM)
- SNS ‚Äî Amazon Simple Notification Service (Not to be confused with SMS)

### Amazon Guides

Amazon provides the following guides setup guides for APNS and GCM. I found some of the information in these to be out of date, or too hairy for a JavaScript developer who can not bring himself to install Eclipse.

- [APNS (iOS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-apns.html)
- [GCM (Android)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-gcm.html)

The steps you are about to read, are split into three sections:

## Base Steps

Create your app with the Cordova CLI tool.

```cli-wrap
cordova create cordova-remote-push-notifications org.apache.cordova.RemotePushNotificationsApp RemotePushNotificationsApp
```

Change to the directory that was created by the Cordova CLI tool.

```cli
cd cordova-remote-push-notifications
```

Install android Android and iOS platforms.

> **Note:** `android@latest` is not currently compatible with `code-push@latest` (2017‚Äì12‚Äì12), so we will need to set the android platform version to `6.3.0`.

```cli
cordova platform add android@6.3.0
cordova platform add ios@latest
```

Install CocoaPods Xcode Package Manager if you do not already have this installed.

```cli
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Setup the Cocoapod `master` repo.

```cli
pod setup
```

Install the Cocoapod depencies in the iOS platform directory.

```cli
cd platforms/ios/
pod install
```

Install `Phonegap-Plugin-Push`.

```cli
cordova plugin add phonegap-plugin-push
```

Add the following code to `www/js/index.js` the `onDeviceReady()` callback:

```js
onDeviceReady: function() {
    this.receivedEvent('deviceready');

    var push = PushNotification.init({
        android: {},
        browser: {
            pushServiceURL: 'http://push.api.phonegap.com/v1/push'
        },
        ios: {
            alert: "true",
            badge: "true",
            sound: "true"
        },
        windows: {}
    });

    push.on('registration', function (data) {
        console.dir(data)
        alert('Event=registration, registrationId=' + data.registrationId)
    });

    push.on('notification', function (data) {
        console.log(data)
        alert('Event=notification, message=' + data.message)
    });

    push.on('error', function (err) {
        console.log(err)
        alert('Event=error, message=' + err.message)
    });
},
```

## iOS APNS Guide

Use the terminal to open the workspace in Xcode.

```cli-wrap
open -a Xcode platforms/ios/RemotePushNotificationsApp.xcworkspace
```

> ### ü§î Choice
>  
> You will be prompted to select:  
>  
> 1. The correct certificate.
> 2. The device you want to push the build to.

While you are in Xcode, Toggle on "Push Notifications".

Build and run your App.

```cli
cordova build ios
cordova run ios
```

> While the app is running on your iOS device, get the `registrationId` logged in the Safari Developer Console. Save this `registrationId` somewhere, you will need to send messages to the device via the Amazon SNS console.

If you click the Done button you will see that your Push cert is now listed.

[![If you click the Done button you will see that your Push cert is now listed.](/img/posts/1_Rpk1w1FCdWVBf1IoL0D5Dg.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_Rpk1w1FCdWVBf1IoL0D5Dg.jpeg "If you click the Done button you will see that your Push cert is now listed.")

Click the Download button to save your push certificate to the Desktop. It should download a file with a `.cer` extension

In your terminal, convert the `.cer` file to a `.pem.`. The Amazon SNS service uses the `.pem` file format.

```cli-wrap
openssl x509 -in ~/Desktop/aps_development.cer -inform DER -out ~/Desktop/PushCert.pem
```

### Obtain the App Private Key

Import the Apple Push Notifications certificate (aps_development.cer) that your downloaded from the Apple Developer Portal earlier, into the Keychain Access app.

[![Import the Apple Push Notifications certificate aps_development.cer that your downloaded from the Apple Developer Portal earlier, into the Keychain Access app.](/img/posts/1__4CBwDrRXB8rHiH2V3ff_Q.jpeg)](/img/posts/1__4CBwDrRXB8rHiH2V3ff_Q.jpeg "Import the Apple Push Notifications certificate aps_development.cer that your downloaded from the Apple Developer Portal earlier, into the Keychain Access app.")

You should see the certificate listed with the name of your app.

[![You should see the certificate listed with the name of your app.](/img/posts/1_NbxsR-xkHP370aQ_P1uMlg.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_NbxsR-xkHP370aQ_P1uMlg.jpeg "You should see the certificate listed with the name of your app.")

Expand your certificate and select the private key. Right click and export your Private Push Key to a `.p12` file.

[![Expand your certificate and select the private key. Right click and export your Private Push Key to a .p12 file.](/img/posts/1_bKqKUAK9JrQYT3oSXQVKBQ.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_bKqKUAK9JrQYT3oSXQVKBQ.jpeg "Expand your certificate and select the private key. Right click and export your Private Push Key to a .p12 file.")

Save the key file to the Desktop, naming it "PushKey".

[![Save the key file to the Desktop, naming it "PushKey".](/img/posts/1_nFVQvXYhfsWco1MrrMovmA.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_nFVQvXYhfsWco1MrrMovmA.jpeg "Save the key file to the Desktop, naming it "PushKey".")

You sill be asked to provide an encryption password for your private key file.

[![You sill be asked to provide an encryption password for your private key file.](/img/posts/1_sSoQ8id0qfaPYS38FWBw8w.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_sSoQ8id0qfaPYS38FWBw8w.jpeg "You sill be asked to provide an encryption password for your private key file.")

You will likely be asked to enter your system or login password in order to export your private key from the Keychain Access app to the file-system.

[![You will likely be asked to enter your system or login password in order to export your private key from the Keychain Access app to the file-system.](/img/posts/1_IGVzq_EMJophqgqWzm1A8A.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_IGVzq_EMJophqgqWzm1A8A.jpeg "You will likely be asked to enter your system or login password in order to export your private key from the Keychain Access app to the file-system.")

Convert the `PushKey.p12` file to a `PushKey.pem` file using `openssl` in your terninal.

```cli-wrap
openssl pkcs12 -in ~/Desktop/PushKey.p12 -out ~/Desktop/PushKey.pem -nodes -clcerts

# Enter Import Password: ************
# MAC verified OK
```

### Verify the Certificate and App Private Key

```cli-wrap
openssl s_client -connect gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195 -cert ~/Desktop/PushCert.pem -key ~/Desktop/PushKey.pem
```

If you see something like the following block in your terminal, then everything is working as expected.

```bash

Name your mobile app appropriately, then click "Choose and configure services".

> **Note:** You will need to pick a valid package name for you app. The package name is the same as the Widget Id from your `config.xml` file. For example if your `config.xml` file looks like this:  
>  
> ```xml  
> <?xml version=‚Äô1.0' encoding=‚Äôutf-8'?>  
> <widget id=‚Äùorg.apache.cordova.RemotePushNotificationsApp‚Äù version=‚Äù1.0.0" xmlns=‚Äùhttp://www.w3.org/ns/widgets" xmlns:cdv=‚Äùhttp://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0">  
> ```  
> ...then use ‚Äúorg.apache.cordova.RemotePushNotificationsApp‚Äù as your package name.

Click on ‚ÄúGenerate Configuration Files‚Äù.

Save this file to your ~/Downloads folder.")

Copy `google-services.json` into your `platforms/android` directory, so that it can be picked up by the Cordova Android build process.

```cli-wrap
cp ~/Downloads/google-services.json platforms/android/google-services.json
```

You will need to add your Sender Id to the `www/js/index.js` file so that Google can connect your app to the notifications endpoint.

```js
onDeviceReady: function() {
    this.receivedEvent('deviceready');
    var push = PushNotification.init({
        android: {
            // Add your Google Mobile App SenderId here
            senderID: 24XXXXXXXXX0
        },
        browser: {
            pushServiceURL: 'http://push.api.phonegap.com/v1/push'
        },
        ios: {
            alert: "true",
            badge: "true",
            sound: "true"
        },
        windows: {}
    });
    ...
}
```

### Update Android Studio Dependencies

Open Android Studio and make sure you have Android Support Repository installed. Don‚Äôt forget to check for Android Studio Updates and installed them!

<!-- missing image: cordova-remote-push-notifications-android-sdk-support-repo.jpg -->

```cli
cp ~/Downloads/google-services.json platforms/android
```

### Build The Android App

You should now be ready to build your Android app.

```cli
cordova build android
cordova run android
```

When your app starts you should see an Alert with your device‚Äôs `registrationId` (Device Token).

[![When your app starts you should see an Alert with your device‚Äôs registrationId (Device Token).](/img/posts/1_q3wodYk23t-eyz8vMM_VRg.jpeg)](/img/posts/1_q3wodYk23t-eyz8vMM_VRg.jpeg "When your app starts you should see an Alert with your device‚Äôs registrationId (Device Token).")

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è &nbsp;Important
> Copy and save the `registrationId` from your Chrome Inspect console.

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è &nbsp;Important

> **You must close the app on your device** to test the push notification is received when the user does not have your app loaded.

After you have closed the app, create and send the following test message in JSON format and click the "Publish message" button.

```js
// INCEPTION:
// You would be right in thinking this JSON looks strange. 
// AWS requies your GCM data to be a Stringified JSON object.
{
    "GCM": "{ \"notification\": { \"text\": \"test message\" } }"
}
```
> **Note:** Android platforms lower than 8.0 may require a different JSON payload, where notifications is swapped for data. You can read more about this issue [on Github](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push/issues/2158), and [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38300450/fcm-with-aws-sns).

You should see confirmation starting with: "Message published‚Ä¶"

Within seconds, you should see a badge appear above your app's home-screen Icon. Also, notice the white square in the top left? This is an indicator that you have a new notification for your app. usually you would replace this with your app Icon.

If you roll down the notification blind, you will see the notification in the list. Notice the little grey square on the left? That is where your app Icon should go.

If you tap on the notification, it will take you into the app. If you remember the iOS steps, your push notification would be replayed inside your app. This is not happening in Android. Instead, you will have to send a second notification.

Now that the app is open, if you send the same payload as you did in the step above, you should see the following alert showing you the notification message that you pushed from Amazon SNS.

> **Note:** This is a caveat of using `notification` instead of `data` in the SNS push notification payload. I am currently learning how to work around this and I plan to update this document when I have a solution to push a single notification to an Android 8.0 device and make it register in both the background, and the foreground.

## Congrats!

You can now send remote push notifications to Android and iOS from your Amazon SNS Console!
