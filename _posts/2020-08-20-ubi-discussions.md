### Thoughts

The economy should be stimulated from all directions, rather than from the top down.

Entities in a Keynesian economy are truly on a treadmill (the business cycle), having to exert energy to move up towards the incoming revenue at the top.

Economies have energy-wells, or hurdles. When economic shortwaves propagate through the system, some entities do not have the financial momentum to cross the gap, falling behind.

Heating your home from only one side of the house, would require much more energy than putting a heater in each room. Our economy is like a house heated on one side. The pipes are creaking and banging, and steam is spewing out of the radiators.

Welfare is not an adequate stimulation of the economy, because the many disincentives it adds, outweigh the benefits.
