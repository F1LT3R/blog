<p>I eat, sleep and dream in code. During the 19 years that I have worked as a software developer, I have experienced bumbling failures and spectacular successes. I make Web & Mobile apps when the sun is shining and tinker with Parallelism, Quantum Computing, and Open Source software when everyone has gone to sleep. I am a passionate advocate for Behavior Driven Development, DevOps, and ZTDD (Zero Technical Debt Development).</p>

<p>In my early career, I focused on pushing the bleeding-edge of web technology. I was a Technical Lead for Mozilla, chaired the Audio Working Group at The W3C, worked on data visualization for Newsweek, developed a Node.js platform for Redbull Studios and wrote an article for the .NET magazine about JavaScript animation. In recent years I have focused on using technology to help solve social problems. I was a Software Architect and Scrum Master for a Web Accessibility company and a Lead Developer for two mobile healthcare apps.</p>

<p>I have been programming since the early 1980's, and started designing and building websites for work during the early 2000's. I have co-founded a company and been the first employee at a tech start-up three times.</p>

<p>I studied Music Technology, Production & Performance at Langley College in England, where my teacher jokingly nicknamed me <b>"Doctor Filter"</b>, because a) every musician was pre-pending their name with "Dr." back then, (E.g., Dr. Dre), and b), because I would apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutoff_frequency">Frequency Cutoff Filters</a> to every channel of the electronic music I produced.

<p>My peers thought this nickname was hilarious, and so it stuck. With an ungodly number of hours playing <a href="http://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2</a> under my belt, my nickname naturally shifted to its present, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">1337</a> form, <b>"F1LT3R"</b>.</p>
