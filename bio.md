<p>I eat, sleep and dream in code. During the 19 years that I have worked as a software developer, I have experienced bumbling failures and spectacular successes. I make Web & Mobile apps when the sun is shining and tinker with Parallelism, Quantum Computing, and Open Source software when everyone has gone to sleep. I am a passionate advocate for Behavior Driven Development, DevOps, and ZTDD (Zero Technical Debt Development).</p>

<p>In my early career, I focused on pushing the bleeding-edge of web technology. I was a Technical Lead for Mozilla, chaired the Audio Working Group at The W3C, worked on data visualization for Newsweek, developed a Node.js platform for Redbull Studios and wrote an article for the .NET magazine about JavaScript animation. In recent years I have focused on using technology to help solve social problems. I was a Software Architect and Scrum Master for a Web Accessibility company and a Lead Developer for two mobile healthcare apps.</p>

<p>I have been programming since the early 1980's, and started designing and building websites for working the early 2000's. I have co-founded a company and been the first employee at a start-up three times.</p>

<p>I studied Music Technology, Production & Performance at Langley College in England, where my teachers nicknamed me: *"Doctor Filter"*, because I would apply [Frequency Cutoff Filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutoff_frequency) to all of the music I produced; over time this nickname shifted to [L337](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) *"F1LT3R"* form.</p>
